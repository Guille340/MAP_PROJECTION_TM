Transverse Mercator Library
============================

MATLAB code for calculation of Easting and Northing from a target geographic 
position, geographic origin, false Northing and Easting, scale factor and
ellipsoid (direct method) and calculation of the target geographic position 
from Easting and Northing, geographic origin, false Northing and Easting, scale 
factor and ellipsoid  (inverse method) using the Transverse Mercator (TM) 
projection with Bowring or Redfearn methods. 

Check the "Docs" folder for more details about the TM projection.
